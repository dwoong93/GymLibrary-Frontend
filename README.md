Gym Library
This web application will allow visitors to browse through community uploaded Exercises and Workouts. 
The main motivation for this project came from my many experiences of sharing workout and exercise routines with the people in the gym and around me. There are many open forums out there, but many of them are forums which have a very wide range of topics.
The Gym Library is solely focused on exercises and workouts and allows anyone and everyone to use and share exercises and WODs (workout of the Day).
